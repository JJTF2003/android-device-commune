## üì± Mobile Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Android Studio (for Android)
- Xcode (for iOS, Mac only)

### Development Setup
1. Clone the repository from GitHub
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run development server: `npm run dev`

### Mobile Deployment Steps
1. **Build the project**: `npm run build`
2. **Add mobile platforms**:
   - Android: `npx cap add android`
   - iOS: `npx cap add ios`
3. **Sync with native platforms**: `npx cap sync`
4. **Run on devices**:
   - Android: `npx cap run android`
   - iOS: `npx cap run ios`

## üîÑ Version Control & Collaboration

### Git Workflow
- All code is managed through Lovable's Git integration
- Automatic commits for all changes
- Easy GitHub export for team collaboration

### Team Collaboration
1. Export project to GitHub using Lovable's "Export to GitHub" feature
2. Team members clone the repository
3. Make changes locally or through Lovable
4. Push changes back to the shared repository
5. Others can pull updates and sync with `npx cap sync`

### Data Sharing
- Export task data as JSON files
- Import data from team members
- Perfect for testing collaboration workflows

## üåê Web Service Integration

Currently implements local storage with export/import capabilities. Ready for backend integration:

### Potential Integrations
- **Firebase**: Real-time database and authentication
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL backend with real-time subscriptions  
- **REST APIs**: Custom backend services
- **IFTTT**: Automation and external service integration

### Current Data Structure
```json
{
  "id": "unique-timestamp",
  "title": "Task title",
  "description": "Optional description", 
  "completed": false,
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "environmentData": {
    "device": {
      "platform": "android",
      "model": "device-model",
      "osVersion": "14.0"
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "location": "Available/Not available"
  }
}
```
